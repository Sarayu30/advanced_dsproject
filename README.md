# # README

## Overview
This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and training machine learning models for one of Cognizant's technology-led clients, Gala Groceries. The project aims to analyze the provided dataset, train multiple regression models, and evaluate their performance. The findings and results are communicated back to the business in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.

## Project Components
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducted using Python and Google Colab.
   - Initial data inspection, cleaning, and visualization.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - A Python module containing code to train multiple regression models.
   - Grid Search with cross-validation is used to find the best hyperparameters.
   - Models used: Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, LightGBM Regressor.
   - Performance metrics calculated: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (RÂ²).

3. **Communication of Results**
   - Findings and analysis are presented in a PowerPoint slide to communicate the results back to the business.

## Setup and Installation
To replicate the analysis and model training, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
   cd project
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:**
   - Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to conduct EDA and train the models.
   - Alternatively, run the provided Python script using:
     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```

 

### Import Libraries
